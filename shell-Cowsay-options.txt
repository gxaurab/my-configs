In the command fortune | cowsay -f <option>, the -f flag specifies a "cowfile," which is an ASCII art template used to display your fortune. You can find a complete list of available cowfiles on your system by running cowsay -l. 

Common options for the -f flag include:

Classic Animal & Character Options
  tux: The Linux penguin.
  dragon: A large ASCII dragon.
  elephant: A detailed elephant.
  bunny: A simple rabbit.
  hellokitty: The popular cartoon character.

Mode Modifiers (Alternative to -f) 
While -f changes the character, you can also use these flags to change the cow's "state of mind":
  -d: Dead cow.
  -g: Greedy cow ($$ in eyes).
  -p: Paranoid cow.
  -s: Stoned/sleepy cow.
  -y: Youthful cow. 

Pro-Tip: If your version of cowsay supports it, you can use -r instead of -f to choose a random template every time.
